# FiveThirtyEightScrape
Scrapes the games for the rest of the year off of 538, with spreads per team.

My goal for this repo was to make it easier to calculate the smartest move for a given week in Survival football leagues.  Rather than going to FiveThirtyEight and manually deciding which team to take this week, I let the algorithm decide the best choices. 

The Excel file "MK_Survival" really does the heavy lifting here.
